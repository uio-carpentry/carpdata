# Carpentry@UiO Data

Data related to Carpentry@UiO for analysis and visualisation.

The idea for this small, community-focused data analysis and visualisation project was formed in the first remote Carpentry@UiO StudyGroup session during the Covid-19 pandemic on March 19, 2020.

We want to show how our local Carpentries community has developed over time, from the first Software Carpentry workshop held in 2012 to the weekly programming and data wrangling workshops in spring 2020. The focus is on the range of things we are teaching in our workshops, the frequency, the interest in workshops and participation rates, as well as the growth of and changing shape of the community as such with all its instructors, helpers, library support staff, policy makers, and non the least: it's learners!

We are welcoming contributions, please consult the general [Contributing](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines of Carpentry@UiO and the Carpentries [Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html)

## Data

Data about the Carpentry@UiO community comes from different sources. Some if these data have personal information, which classifies them as non openly sharable unless anonymized. We are currently working on anonymizing data so it can be shared and published. For the time being, only data that does not contain any personal information will be available on this repository. For the purpose of a quick overview, we use the [University of Oslo's data classification guide](https://www.uio.no/english/services/it/security/lsis/data-classes.html). All data that can be shared openly and freely is green, all data that contains personal, but non-sensitive data, is yellow (and cannot be shared openly before anonymisation). Published personal information (non-sensitive), e.g. names of instructors on public websites, is green data.
